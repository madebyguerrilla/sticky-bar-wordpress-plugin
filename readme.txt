Add a customizable sticky bar to the top of your website for notifications, promotions and more.

== Description ==

Add a customizable sticky notification bar to the top of your website. Perfect for grabbing the attention of your visitors, even as they scroll down the page.

**What can you change?**

There is a built in settings page that allows you to choose the color of the bar and text, customize the text that is displayed as well as the link the bar points to.

**A special thank you**

I came across the [Sticky Alerts](http://longren.io/sticky-alerts-a-new-tiny-jquery-plugin/) jQuery script recently and wanted to bring it to WordPress as a customizable plugin. So, thank you to Tyler for writing the original jQuery script and allowing people to play with the code.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to SETTINGS / STICKY BAR and adjust the sticky bar settings.
